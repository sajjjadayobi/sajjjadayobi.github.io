# Hello, I'm Sajjad Ayoubi ðŸ‘‹

At 23, I currently lead a team @ [Divar.ir](https://divar.ir), the largest classified ad platform in the Middle East. My team and I are dedicated to optimize human-in-the-loop processes with advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs) and other machine learning techniques. Over the years, I've developed a keen interest in deep learning and machine learning, striving to create solutions that tackle real-world problems in various sectors.

I became fascinated with coding as a teenager, enjoying how it allowed me to construct things and learn from failures without significant cost. This led me to teach myself through resources like YouTube, where I learned not just programming but also English and AI. I believe in the power of small, daily improvements with books, blogs and videos. I'm also intrested in psychology, decision making and neuroscience or anything related to human nature.

Writing helps me to process what Iâ€™ve learned and to share insights with others. 
I write knowlege docs, personal and life docs and many other things ðŸ˜ƒ

> Now let's solve problems.
