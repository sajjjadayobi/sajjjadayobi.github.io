As the lead data scientist at Divar, the largest classified ads platform in the Middle East, my goal is to perpetually learn and teach while addressing real-world challenges using my expertise in data science, software development, leadership, and project management. My robust problem-solving abilities further support this mission.

I am dedicated to studying machine learning, software systems, leadership, and decision-making on a regular basis. I apply this knowledge to tackle the exciting projects my team and I work on daily. I am eager to share more insights about the real problems we encounter and the solutions we implement. Previously, I conducted weekly knowledge-sharing meetings with my team to facilitate this exchange. Now, I aim to extend this initiative to a broader audience, making it more impactful and substantial. Writing down my learnings helps me distill ideas and enhances my ability to both learn and teach. I want to expand these efforts further.

My long-term objectives include enhancing my knowledge, strengthening my personal brand, and improving my English skills, both written and spoken. Additionally, I aspire to achieve career promotions, attract job offers, generate passive income, and become more proficient in my primary role while maintaining a clear focus.

## Avaliable Options Right Now
I'm considering several opportunities, such as writing a blog to document my experiences, challenges, and solutions. I could do this either on Medium or my personal blog. Additionally, I might create tutorials or courses, or start a newsletter centered around my field and experiences. Another option is to become a YouTuber, posting weekly videos on various topics like tech news, podcasts with other experts, educational content, updates on my latest projects, solving challenges on platforms like LeetCode and Kaggle, discussing research papers, providing tutorials on concepts and projects, reviewing tools, books, and courses, or conducting interviews and facilitating mock interviews. This content can be produced in both text and video formats, each suited to different types of information.

Another possibility is creating courses for my own platform or other platforms, or making YouTube playlists with ads and a Patreon channel.
Currently, there are a few challenges. Producing video content requires a higher initial investment in equipment and editing software, as well as a quiet location for recording. Additionally, the editing process is time-consuming.

My goal is to create something that endures beyond a few weeks and doesn't require constant updates to remain relevant. The content should be more educational and comprehensive rather than simple news updates and shouldn't demand a full-time commitment. I want the flexibility to work on it whenever I choose.
I should record my speeches and lectures and write about them. I could write a new blog post or create a video for each of my presentations. I can present the drafts of my blog posts in company knowledge-sharing meetings, along with other materials, and use the feedback to refine them for publication.

## Start Simple, Iterate Fast
I believe I can pursue all these ideas without limiting myself to a single platform or medium. It's a two-way door decision and I just need to start. I can begin with writing and blogging to improve my English writing and language skills. From there, I can work on enhancing my speaking abilities, eventually moving on to producing YouTube videos and creating courses and playlists. I need to deeply consider each option and document everything I learn along the way. This approach allows me to refine my ideas and adapt as I go.

**here is my Plan: Starting with Blogs, Then YouTube Videos**

I will start by building an initial audience through writing and blogging, and then expand to include videos. This approach offers the flexibility to create both written and video content, catering to different audience preferences. By doing so, I can create a synergy where blog posts can be transformed into video scripts and video content can be transcribed into blog posts. This dual approach provides SEO benefits, improving search engine visibility with both written and video content. Additionally, it enhances personal branding by showcasing my expertise across multiple formats. The process will help develop my writing, speaking, and presentation skills. Both blog posts and videos have a long-lasting impact, as they can continue to attract viewers over time. Furthermore, both platforms offer monetization potential through ads, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing, providing opportunities for passive income in the future. I can also post my videos on the blog as new posts.

## How Do I Strat Writing?
To begin writing effectively, I need a platform to publish and reach my audience. I currently write on Medium but also have my own website where I publish content. I am considering a hybrid approach that leverages both platforms. Initially, I plan to publish my content on my personal blog and then republish it on Medium using their import tool. This strategy will allow me to reach a wider audience through Medium while driving traffic back to my personal blog. As my audience grows, I will gradually focus more on my personal blog while still maintaining a presence on Medium.

## How to get better at It:
To improve my writing and content creation skills, I need to think in documents and blogs. Writing for myself has always helped me analyze and solve problems, and now I need to transform these insights into digestible blog posts that others can learn from. Recording my speeches and lectures will also be valuable. I should write about these presentations and share them on my platforms, either as blog posts or videos. Presenting drafts of my blogs in company knowledge-sharing meetings can provide me with feedback to refine them for publication. As I document my learnings and experiences for myself, it's now time to make them publishable.

Additionally, studying successful content creators like Jadi, Jeremy Havard, Yannic Kilcher, Chip Huyen, Alfredo Canziani, Andrej Karpathy, Daniel Bourke and Lex Fridman will be crucial. By following their work and learning from their methods, I can continually improve my own content creation skills.
