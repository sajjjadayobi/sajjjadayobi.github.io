At 23 years old, based in Iran, I currently have the opportunity to serve as a lead data scientist at [Divar.ir](https://divar.ir), a prominent classified ads platform in the Middle East. My primary focus is on constant learning and knowledge sharing while addressing real-world issues using data science, software development, leadership, and project management skills. I have a strong passion for problem-solving and am always seeking ways to enhance my abilities in this area by reading books, working on problems and studying others.

I'm committed to regularly enhancing my understanding of machine learning, software systems, leadership, decision-making and etc. I use what I learn to contribute to the exciting projects my team and I handle every day. Sharing insights about the challenges we face and the solutions we create is something I'm keen on. I used to hold weekly knowledge-sharing sessions with our company, and now I'm looking to share these insights with a wider audience. Moving forward, I plan to broaden this initiative to reach more people, hoping to make it even more enriching and impactful. Writing about my experiences and learnings sharpens my ideas and improves my teaching and learning processes, and I am eager to develop this practice further.

Looking ahead, I want to deepen my knowledge, build my personal reputation, and improve my English, both in writing and speaking. I also hope to advance in my career, attract new job opportunities, earn a side income, and excel in my current role, all while staying focused on my main objectives.

# How to Learn and Teach More
I've previously managed bootcamps, taught courses, and mentored interns in machine learning. Now, I'm looking at different ways to share what I've learned. One idea is to start a blog where I can write about my experiences, the challenges I've faced, and the solutions I've discovered. I'm considering using platforms like Medium or setting up my personal blog for this purpose.

Another approach could be to develop tutorials or courses, or perhaps start a newsletter that delves into topics related to my field and experiences. I'm also thinking about creating a YouTube channel to post weekly videos on a variety of subjects. These could include tech news, podcasts with other experts, educational content, updates on my latest projects, challenge-solving sessions on platforms like LeetCode and Kaggle, discussions on research papers, tutorials on various concepts and projects, reviews of tools, books, and courses, or even conducting interviews and mock interviews. I can produce content in both text and video formats, choosing the best medium for the topic at hand.
Additionally, I could create courses for my platform or others, or even compile YouTube playlists. These might feature ads and be supported by a Patreon channel.

At the moment, there are some hurdles to consider. Video production demands a significant upfront investment in equipment and editing software, as well as a quiet space for recording. The editing process itself can be quite time-consuming.

My aim is to create content that is lasting and doesn't need frequent updates to stay relevant. I prefer to focus on educational and comprehensive material rather than just updating on current news. Importantly, I want this project to be manageable on a flexible schedule, without requiring a full-time commitment.
To make the most of my current activities, I plan to record my speeches and lectures and write about them. Each presentation could become a blog post or a video. I could also present drafts of my blog posts during company knowledge-sharing sessions, using the feedback to refine them before they go live. This approach helps me stay connected with my audience and continuously improve the content I share.

# Start Simple, Iterate Fast
I'm convinced that I can explore all these ideas without restricting myself to just one platform or format. This is a reversible tow way door decision, and the key is to just get started. Initially, I plan to focus on writing and blogging, which will help me improve my English writing skills and language proficiency. As I grow more comfortable, I can gradually transition into enhancing my speaking skills, which will naturally lead into producing YouTube videos and designing courses and playlists.
While considering each option, it's important for me to document everything I learn along the way. Adopting this method will allow me to continuously refine my ideas and adjust my approach based on feedback and experience. This iterative process ensures that I can develop my projects effectively, learning and adapting as I progress.

# Starting with Blogs, Then YouTube Videos
I will start by building an initial audience through writing and blogging, and then expand to include videos. This approach offers the flexibility to create both written and video content, catering to different audience preferences. By doing so, I can create a synergy where blog posts can be transformed into video scripts and video content can be transcribed into blog posts. This dual approach provides SEO benefits, improving search engine visibility with both written and video content. Additionally, it enhances personal branding by showcasing my expertise across multiple formats. The process will help develop my writing, speaking, and presentation skills. Both blog posts and videos have a long-lasting impact, as they can continue to attract viewers over time. Furthermore, both platforms offer monetization potential through ads, sponsorships, and affiliate marketing, providing opportunities for passive income in the future. I can also post my videos on the blog as new posts.

# Beginning My Writing Journey
To kickstart my writing efforts effectively, choosing the right platform to connect with my audience is crucial. I have previously written on Medium and received positive feedback, which was encouraging. Additionally, I have my own website where I publish content. Considering both options, I am leaning towards a hybrid approach that maximizes the strengths of each platform.
My initial strategy will involve publishing articles first on my personal blog, and then republishing them on Medium using their import tool. This tactic will help me reach a broader audience via Medium while also directing traffic back to my personal website. This dual-platform presence not only enhances visibility but also fosters a sense of community around my content.
As my audience expands, I plan to gradually shift more focus towards my personal blog, although I will maintain an active presence on Medium. This approach will allow me to build a dedicated reader base while keeping the channels open for new readers to discover my work.

# How to get better at It
To improve my writing and content creation skills, I need to think in documents and blogs. Writing for myself has always helped me analyze and solve problems, and now I need to transform these insights into digestible blog posts that others can learn from. Recording my speeches and lectures will also be valuable. I should write about these presentations and share them on my platforms, either as blog posts or videos. Presenting drafts of my blogs in company knowledge-sharing meetings can provide me with feedback to refine them for publication. As I document my learnings and experiences for myself, it's now time to make them publishable.
Additionally, studying successful content creators like Jadi, Jeremy Havard, Yannic Kilcher, Chip Huyen, Alfredo Canziani, Andrej Karpathy, Daniel Bourke and Lex Fridman will be crucial. By following their work and learning from their methods, I can continually improve my own content creation skills.

# Investing in Learning
As I embark on this journey to enhance my writing and communication skills, I recognize the importance of continuous learning. There are several key areas I plan to focus on to deepen my expertise and become more effective in my endeavors. I have questions like: How to increase the quality of my wirtings? or How to advertise and markting for my writings?
